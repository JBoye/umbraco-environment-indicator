# Umbraco CMS Environment Indicator

When developing websites using Umbraco in multi-environment solution, you can often get confused which environment you are currently looking at.

As a visual aid, this package will add a colour-coded indicator in the CMS back-office - this is applied to both the favicon (in the browser tab/title-bar) and adds a stripe to your avatar (in the top-left navigation).

This package was developed and tested against Umbraco v7+ on the [Umbraco-as-a-Service](https://www.umbraco.io) platform.
